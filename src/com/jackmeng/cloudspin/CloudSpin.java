/**
 * This class is used for general graphical manipulation.

 * For example taking an image and blurring it.
 *
 * In contrast to {@link com.jackmeng.cloudspin.CloudSpinner} this class is
 * much more simple to use to communicate with. However, in terms of simplicity,
 * and processes handling, this class does not retain the best in terms of
 * allowing
 * for general manipulation and access to the process.
 *
 * This package is intended to replace the overburdened
 * {@link com.jackmeng.halcyon.utils.DeImage}
 * which has been here since 2.0 and features the old burden class style of
 * having a util
 * class that handles a lot of functions.
